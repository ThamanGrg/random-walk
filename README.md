# Random Walk

This project visualizes a random walk using Python.  
A random walk is a mathematical process that shows a path made of random steps.  
The goal of this project is to practice Python basics, lists, and data visualization using Matplotlib.


## Project Features
- Generates random walk data
- Visualizes the path using a scatter plot
- Hides axes for a clean visualization
- Highlights the starting and ending points

## How to run program
1. Install the Matplotlib module if not installed.
- pip install matplotlib
2. Run the "plot.py" file.

## Output
The program displays a plot showing a random path created by step-by-step movement in random directions.
